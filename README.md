## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Software Engineer who is passionate about the Tech Field, I have a deep understanding of Information Technology and I'm enthusiastic about improving my skillset and knowledge till the death of me. I learned web development in 2018 and ever since I started going deeper by learning UI/UX then low level programming and bash scripting. My best programming language however is C because it made me good at higher level programming languages like Python and Javascript haha.
